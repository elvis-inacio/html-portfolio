<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an Information Systems Graduate. I studied at the University of Cape Town from 2020 until 2023.</p>

<p>Studying at UCT has been a very good experience for me as it allowed me 
  to know new people and experience different cultures.</p>

<p>I have a very big interest in technology and I would love to work in the tech industry as it is forever evolving
  and I would love very much to be apart of that evolution and give some contribution.
